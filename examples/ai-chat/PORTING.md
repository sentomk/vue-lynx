# PORTING.md — Nuxt AI Chat → Vue Lynx

Tracks what was **reused** from the original [nuxt-ui-templates/chat](https://github.com/nuxt-ui-templates/chat) (and its SPA sibling [chat-vue](https://github.com/nuxt-ui-templates/chat-vue)) versus **rewritten** for Lynx, and why. Feature-level parity status lives in [PRD.md](./PRD.md); this doc is about *how* each layer was ported.

## Ground rules discovered up front

Why a straight copy is impossible:

1. **No DOM.** Lynx renders native elements (`view`, `text`, `image`, `scroll-view`, `list`, `input`, …), not HTML. Nuxt UI v4 renders HTML through Reka UI primitives (portals, popovers, focus traps) — none of that runs on Lynx. Every `U*` component used by the template must be re-implemented.
2. **No Nuxt.** No auto-imports, no Nitro server in-process, no `useFetch`/`useCookie`/`useAppConfig`/`useOverlay`. Vue 3 itself (Composition API, SFCs, vue-router with memory history, reactivity) works unchanged on Vue Lynx — that's the part we keep.
3. **Dual-thread model.** Vue runs on the background thread; layout/PAPI on the main thread. Browser globals (`window`, `document`, `crypto`, `URL`, `localStorage`) can't be assumed.
4. **The server half must exist somewhere.** The original's Nitro routes + AI SDK `streamText` move to a small standalone Node server, kept API-compatible.

## Layer-by-layer

| Layer | Original | Port | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Framework | Nuxt 4 (Vue 3) | Vue Lynx (Vue 3) | **Reused** — Vue 3 semantics are the whole point of the port |
| Routing | Nuxt pages (vue-router web history) | vue-router `createMemoryHistory` | **Reused with config change** |
| UI kit | @nuxt/ui v4 (`UDashboard*`, `UChat*`, `UButton`, `UModal`, …) | Hand-built Lynx components mirroring Nuxt UI's rendered look (tokens copied from its theme) | **Rewritten** — DOM-only |
| Chat state | `@ai-sdk/vue` `useChat` + `DefaultChatTransport` | Custom `useChat` composable speaking the same UI-message-stream protocol: SSE on web, cursor polling + explicit cancellation on native | **Rewritten (protocol reused)** — the AI SDK client assumes browser streaming primitives |
| Message model | AI SDK `UIMessage` with typed parts (text/reasoning/tool-*/source-url/file) | Same shapes, local TS types | **Reused (types re-declared)** |
| Markdown | Comark + Shiki (HTML output, streaming highlight) | Custom markdown → Lynx-element renderer (including pipe tables) + tiny code tokenizer | **Rewritten** — HTML output can't be displayed; no `v-html` on Lynx |
| Charts | nuxt-charts (Unovis, SVG) | Line chart generated as an inline SVG string for Lynx's native `<svg>` element; hover tooltip becomes tap-a-column | **Rewritten** — no DOM/Unovis; SVG string generation instead |
| Icons | Iconify (`i-lucide-*`, `i-simple-icons-*`, `i-logos-*`) CSS masks | Same glyphs vendored as inline SVG strings (lucide-static / simple-icons / iconify logos) rendered with `<svg content>`; colors baked per theme | **Adapted** — no CSS mask/iconify runtime, no `currentColor` |
| Animations | motion-v (springs), CSS transitions, View Transitions API | Lynx CSS transitions/animations; View Transitions dropped | **Partially rewritten / dropped** |
| Composables (`useChats` grouping, `useModels`, `useChatActions` flows, greeting logic, `getMergedParts`) | Plain Vue + date-fns | Same code, `useCookie`→storage shim, `$fetch`→`fetch` wrapper, modals via custom overlay | **Mostly reused** — this is framework-agnostic logic |
| Server API (chats/messages/votes/title/visibility CRUD) | Nitro `defineEventHandler` + Drizzle/SQLite | Standalone zero-dependency `node:http` server, same routes/payloads, JSON-file store | **Rewritten thin, shapes reused** |
| AI endpoint | AI SDK `streamText` + gateway + provider/custom tools, `smoothStream`, `stopWhen`, UI-message-stream response | Zero-dependency OpenAI-compatible Gateway adapter for real text/reasoning + `gpt-4.1-nano` titles; deterministic tool-capable mock stream by default | **Protocol adapted / mock added** — provider-defined tools and the multi-step tool loop remain mock-only |
| Serverless demo | n/a (Nitro is always present in a Nuxt app) | In-app fallback backend (`lib/local-backend.ts`): when the API server is unreachable (website `<Go>` playground, LynxExplorer scans, `pnpm dev` without the server) the same seeded data + mock streams run in-memory via `shared/mock-ai.mjs` | **Added** — needed because a Lynx bundle can travel without its server |
| Custom tools (weather, chart) | `tool()` + zod, simulated data | Same logic in mock server | **Reused (ported to plain TS)** |
| Auth | GitHub OAuth via nuxt-auth-utils (popup + cookie session) | Mock session endpoint (demo user), header-token session | **Rewritten (mocked)** — OAuth popups/secrets unsuitable for a Lynx example |
| File uploads | NuxtHub Blob + drag&drop + `<input type=file>` | Demo-image picker (bundled samples), same chip/preview/message UI | **Adapted** — no file picker/DnD in Lynx |
| Persistence of prefs (model, theme) | Cookies | Storage abstraction (web localStorage / in-memory fallback) | **Rewritten** |
| Styling | Tailwind v4 + Nuxt UI theme CSS vars | Tailwind v3 + `@lynx-js/tailwind-preset`, with Nuxt UI's semantic tokens (`text-muted`, `bg-elevated`, `border-default`, …) recreated as `--ui-*` CSS variables + custom utilities, so ported markup keeps its class vocabulary | **Adapted** — original classes mostly survive |

## Decision log

- **2026-07-11** Chose `nuxt-ui-templates/chat` (canonical Nuxt template) as the source of truth; `chat-vue` consulted for de-Nuxtified patterns (shared composables, Nitro-external server, session endpoint).
- **2026-07-11** Server strategy: mock-first (deterministic, offline, screenshot-stable), real AI Gateway passthrough behind `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` — mirrors the original's "works on Vercel, key locally" spirit without shipping secrets.
- **2026-07-11** Auth strategy: mock demo-user login to keep every auth-gated surface (user menu, uploads, owner-only actions, greeting) testable in screenshots.
- **2026-07-12** Native streaming strategy: choose poll mode before the generation POST, consume cursor events incrementally, and cancel active server streams explicitly on Stop/unmount.
- **2026-07-12** Parity hardening: enforce globally unique chat ids, remount chat state on route-param navigation, persist color mode, render Markdown tables, and add an example-local regression suite.


## Platform learnings (found while porting, verified on Lynx for Web)

1. **`<textarea>` is unmapped on the web platform.** `LYNX_TAG_TO_HTML_TAG_MAP` in
   `@lynx-js/web-core` has `input` → `x-input` but no `textarea` entry, so `<textarea>` falls
   through as a raw, unwired HTML element. The prompt uses a single-line `<input>` instead
   (PRD F2.2).
2. **`justify-*` utilities are missing from `@lynx-js/tailwind-preset`** (`justifyContent`
   isn't in its core-plugin list, though `alignItems`/`gap`/`grid*` are). Declared manually in
   `App.css`.
3. **SFC `<style>` blocks are scoped per component** through Lynx's `cssId` mechanism even
   without the `scoped` attribute — a class defined in one component's style block does not
   apply to elements of another component. Cross-component classes live in the globally
   imported `App.css`.
4. **Translucent backgrounds don't composite over sibling content** in the Lynx web preview
   (opaque backgrounds paint; `rgba(...)`/alpha-gradient backgrounds on an overlay don't, in
   both headless and headed Chromium, while the same markup outside `lynx-view` paints fine).
   Modal backdrops are approximated by fading the app content (`opacity: 0.4`) behind the
   overlay instead.
5. **`<svg content="...">` renders through a blob-URL `<img>`** (web-elements `XSvg`), so
   `currentColor` never inherits — icon/logo/chart colors are baked into the SVG strings from
   the reactive theme (`useTheme().toneColor`).
6. **Streaming state must mutate reactive proxies, not raw objects.** Pushing a raw object into
   a `ref([])` and then mutating the raw reference bypasses Vue's property-level dependency
   tracking (components freeze mid-stream). `useChat` pushes then reads back
   `messages.value[i]` and mutates the returned proxy.
7. **Cross-origin assets need `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`** — the web preview
   page sets `COEP: require-corp`.
8. **Element methods** (`scrollTo` on `scroll-view`) go through template refs:
   `ref.invoke({ method, params }).exec()`, after `await nextTick()` so the main thread has
   applied pending ops.
9. **No viewport media queries.** Responsive behavior (the original's `lg:` breakpoint) is
   re-created by reading the `SystemInfo` global (`pixelWidth / pixelRatio` = logical width —
   web-core populates it from `screen.availWidth * devicePixelRatio`) and branching the layout
   in code (`useViewport`). Detection is startup-only in this example.
10. **Flex `gap` counts zero-size placeholder siblings.** Vue's `v-if`/`v-else-if` chains and
    `v-for` fragments leave empty placeholder nodes (`<text>`/comment anchors) in the DOM. On
    Lynx's web platform these are flex children, so a container's `gap` adds spacing around each
    one — a markdown block list with 5-branch `v-if` chains between items ends up with 2-3× the
    intended spacing. Fix: wrap each item in a single `<view>` (confining its internal chain)
    and space with per-item `margin-top` keyed on the loop index (`bi > 0`), not container
    `gap` (which would still space around the `v-for` anchors). See `MarkdownView.vue` /
    `MessageContent.vue`.
11. **`fetch` must be `globalThis.fetch`** — the web platform's runtime wrapper shadows the
   `fetch` binding with an undefined parameter (known repo convention, applies here too).
12. **Choose the stream transport before sending a mutating request.** A non-streaming native
    `fetch` buffers an SSE response, so probing with a normal generation POST either loses
    incremental rendering or risks a second generation. Native now starts `?mode=poll` directly.
13. **Vue Router reuses route components when only params change.** The root keys `RouterView`
    by `route.fullPath`, and `ChatPage` aborts its stream on unmount, so `/chat/a` → `/chat/b`
    cannot retain or mutate the first chat's state.
14. **Empty Vue anchors have intrinsic height on native Lynx.** Native `<text>` assigns a 14px
    default line box even when the text is empty. Materialising Vue comment anchors and empty
    text VNodes therefore inflated a one-line user bubble from 24px to 136px and inserted the
    same phantom height between Markdown blocks. The renderer now keeps comments in the
    Background Thread shadow tree only and lazily inserts text VNodes on the Main Thread while
    they contain visible text. Native SVG also does not render the menu glyph's `<line>`
    primitives reliably, so the hamburger uses equivalent `<path>` segments.
