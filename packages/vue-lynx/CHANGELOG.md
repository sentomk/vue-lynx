# vue-lynx

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Route native `globalEventFromLepus` global events to `GlobalEventEmitter` and add the `useGlobalEvent` composable. ([#193](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/193))

- Fix MT worklet loader dropping non-relative imports from the module graph. Aliased, tsconfig-path, and package worklets are now resolved and followed, so they no longer fail at runtime. Imports inside comments and string/template literals are ignored when following the worklet graph. Adds opt-in `includeWorkletPackages` to follow worklet imports into named `node_modules` packages. ([#190](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/190))

- fix(runtime): suppress empty native layout anchors ([#201](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/201))

  Vue's renderer emits comment nodes (`v-if`/`v-for` fragment anchors) and empty text nodes as real host nodes. Previously these were materialized on the Lynx Main Thread as native elements. An empty native `<text>` still gets a default line box from Lynx's layout engine, so these anchors introduced phantom vertical spacing between rendered content.

  Comment anchors are now kept entirely off the Main Thread, and empty text nodes are materialized lazily — a native `<text>` element is created only while the node actually holds visible text, and is removed again when its content becomes empty. This eliminates the spurious gaps without changing the Background Thread VNode tree that Vue reconciles against.

- fix(v-model): apply programmatic value changes to native `<input>`/`<textarea>` ([#203](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/203))

  `vModelText` pushed value updates to the Main Thread via `OP.SET_PROP` →
  `__SetAttribute(el, 'value', …)`. Native (iOS/Android) treats an input's `value`
  prop as the _initial_ value only — a post-mount attribute write is ignored once
  the control is live — so programmatic model changes (a reset/clear button, or
  any code that reassigns the bound ref) never updated the on-screen field. Typing
  still worked, and web was unaffected because web-core reflects the `value`
  attribute live, which masked the gap.

  On a programmatic change `vModelText` now also invokes the platform's `setValue`
  UI method on the element, which is the supported way to set input text
  imperatively across iOS/Android/Harmony/Web. User keystrokes are unaffected
  (that path already no-ops the value push to avoid clobbering the caret), and the
  `SET_PROP` attribute write is retained for web and the initial value.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- fix: export `mergeModels` compiler runtime helper ([#187](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/187))

  Vue 3.4+'s SFC compiler emits `import { mergeModels } from 'vue'` when `defineModel()` is used alongside an explicit `defineProps()` or `defineEmits()` call. `mergeModels` was missing from vue-lynx's re-exports, which caused an `ESModulesLinkingError` at build time. The helper is now re-exported so this `defineModel()` usage pattern works out of the box.

- fix(types): re-export Vue core type aliases and drop stale Volar plugin entries ([#188](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/188))

  - Re-export `Ref`, `ComputedRef`, `WritableComputedRef`, `ShallowRef`, `UnwrapRef`, `UnwrapNestedRefs`, `MaybeRef`, `MaybeRefOrGetter`, `Reactive`, `DeepReadonly`, `VNode`, `VNodeRef`, `VNodeChild`, `DefineComponent`, `FunctionalComponent`, `ComponentInternalInstance`, `SetupContext`, `Plugin`, `Directive`, `InjectionKey`, `PropType`, `ExtractPropTypes`, `EmitsOptions`, `SlotsType`, `WatchOptions`, `WatchHandle`, `WatchStopHandle` from `vue-lynx` so consumers that alias `vue → vue-lynx` for types pick them up.
  - Drop the legacy Volar plugin handlers for Vue Language Tools ≤ 1.8.27 (EOL 2023) and ≤ 2.0.13 (Feb 2024). Only the modern `>= 2.0.14` handler remains; the legacy `version: 1` handler triggered a warning on every run, and the middle handler was strictly subsumed by the modern one.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(events): implement `withModifiers` — `.once`, `.stop`, `.self`, `.prevent` ([#155](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/155))

  `withModifiers` was previously a no-op stub, so event modifiers had no effect at runtime. This implements all four:

  - `.once` — handler fires at most once. The wrapper is cached on `fn._withMods` so the `called` flag is stable across re-renders. Also handles the compiler-emitted `onTapOnce` prop-key path in `node-ops.ts` with a stable `OnceWrapper` per registration.
  - `.stop` — sets `_lynxCatch` on the wrapper so `patchProp` registers a native `catchEvent` binding (the only reliable mechanism since Lynx bubbling is decided on the Main Thread before BG-thread JS handlers run). Also calls `event.stopPropagation()` for DOM/test environments.
  - `.self` — skips the handler when the event originated on a child. Compares by `uid` (Lynx native) or `uniqueId` (Lynx web preview, set by `createCrossThreadEvent`), falling back to reference equality in DOM/test environments. Fixes two bugs where `.self` was unconditionally blocking every event.
  - `.prevent` — accepted as a compatibility no-op so web code runs unmodified. Lynx has no browser default actions to cancel.

  Also fixes `fireEvent` in `@vue-lynx/testing-library` to not `Object.assign` read-only `EventInit` keys (`bubbles`, `cancelable`, `composed`) onto constructed events.

- feat(runtime): support `<KeepAlive>` component (#153) ([`a8ad5ba`](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/commit/a8ad5bab11f397f14aa2471f553923fc18512405))

  Caches inactive component instances instead of destroying them. When a component is toggled back in, its state is preserved.

  - `include`, `exclude`, and `max` props are all supported
  - `onActivated` and `onDeactivated` lifecycle hooks fire as expected

- feat: support `<style scoped>` in Vue SFCs (#78) ([#151](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/151))

  Bridges Vue's scoped CSS to Lynx's native `cssId` system:

  - Build-time: `VueScopedCSSIdPlugin` injects `?cssId=<N>` into vue scoped style module queries so `@lynx-js/css-extract-webpack-plugin` wraps CSS in `@cssId`
  - Build-time: `vueScopeStripCSSPlugin` removes `[data-v-xxx]` attribute selectors (unsupported by Lynx CSS engine)
  - Runtime: `scope-bridge.ts` converts `__scopeId` to numeric cssId and calls `__SetCSSId` on elements

- feat(runtime): support `<Teleport>` component ([#161](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/161))

  Implement `querySelector` via BG-side `idRegistry` to enable `<Teleport to="#target">`
  pattern without cross-thread infrastructure changes.

  - `to` supports `#id` string selectors
  - Dev warning emitted for unsupported selector types
  - idRegistry cleaned up on element removal

- feat(v-once): verify and document `v-once` directive support ([#176](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/176))

  `v-once` works in Vue Lynx without any configuration. The SFC template compiler emits a `setBlockTracking(-1/+1)` pair around a `_cache` slot assignment; on subsequent renders the cached VNode is returned directly, so no ops enter the buffer and `callLepusMethod` is never called for that subtree.

  `setBlockTracking` was already re-exported from `@vue/runtime-core` but was undocumented (`@hidden`). This change promotes it to a public, documented export so its role in `v-once` codegen is explicit.

  In Lynx, `v-once` eliminates the entire cross-thread op batch for the cached subtree — not just DOM diffing — making it more impactful than in a browser environment.

- feat(dx): Volar plugin IDE diagnostics and full Lynx element type coverage ([#169](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/169))

  - All 19 Lynx built-in elements (`view`, `text`, `image`, `scroll-view`, `list`, `list-item`, `input`, `textarea`, `overlay`, `svg`, and others) now resolve via `GlobalComponents` with correct `VueLynxProps` types — no more "Unknown component" errors or incorrect HTML/SVG attribute types on hover
  - Unsupported event modifier diagnostic: using `.capture` or `.passive` on `v-on` now shows a Lynx-specific IDE error at the modifier site
  - `global-bind*`, `global-catch*`, and `main-thread-*` props typed for both template source and Volar-normalised camelCase forms — no "unknown prop" errors, correct function/ref types, completions work
  - `main-thread-ref` and `mainThreadRef` typed as MainThreadRef-like objects
  - `generate:native-tags` script regenerates the element list after upgrading `@lynx-js/types`

### Patch Changes

- fix(types): widen `class` prop to accept Vue class binding forms ([#174](https://github.com/Huxpro/vue-lynx/pull/174))

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 735b678: feat: support `v-bind()` in `<style>` blocks via Lynx-native `useCssVars`
