/**
 * Defers Vue app.mount() until Lynx's renderPage lifecycle fires.
 *
 * Used by IFR (Instant First-Frame Rendering): on the main thread the user's
 * `createApp(App).mount()` runs at bundle-evaluation time, *before* Lynx has
 * created the page (`renderPage`).  We store the mount function and expose a
 * `__vueLynxIfrMountApps` hook on globalThis; the main-thread bootstrap
 * (`vue-lynx/main-thread` ifr.ts) calls it from inside `renderPage` once the
 * page root exists.  If renderPage already fired we mount immediately.
